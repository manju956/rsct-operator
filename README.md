    - [Create `RSCT` resource](#create-rsct-resource)
    - [Check that the Operator is Running](#check-if-the-operator-is-running)
    - [Removing the `RSCT` Operator](#remove-the-rsct-operator)

### Installing the `RSCT` Operator
Run the following command to deploy the `RSCT` Operator:
```sh
oc create -k "https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/rsct-operator/config/default/?ref=main"
```

### Create `RSCT` resource
1. Create the cluster role binding and `RSCT` resources
   ```sh
   oc create -k "https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/rsct-operator/config/samples/?ref=main"
   ```

### Check that the Operator is Running
Check that the pods have been created and are running
```sh
oc get pods -n rsct-operator-system
```

A readiness probe will check that each pod is running, which can take up to 10 minutes.

Output should be similar to the following
```

```

### Removing the `RSCT` Operator
